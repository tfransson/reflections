When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I would want to access it from another computer or if I collaborate with other persons. 
    It could also be good to have the remote as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If your local repository automatically updates the remote repository, changes that you do not want to be public will be, if the remote repository is public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of someones GitHub repo which is present on your GitHub account. 
    A clone is a copy of a repo on your local machine, either from a remote repo or a local one.
    A branch is a different version of a collection of files in a repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you have no internet access you can look at the last know common ancestor of your latest local commit an the latest remote commit.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    If you are working on the same part of code and are in the same place it might be easier to just discuss and compare/write code IRL, 
    but if you work on different parts of the code and/or are on different locations using GitHub is probably easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If you collaborate with others you might want them to look at the code and give feedback or make changes before merging them into master. Then a separete branch is appropriate. Changing directly in master, though, will maybe be less fuss, but risky and might not be popular with your collaborators.
