- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When you run the command "git init" you create the .git directory (which is the repository?). This is where the meta data (all committed versions) will be saved.

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a landing spot in between the working directory and the repository. You add files into the staging area before committing them, which is nice since you can choose what files you want to commit. (You can add all files in the working directory by typing "git add --all".)
